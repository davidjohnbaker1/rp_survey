Recognizing intervals, say, is probably something that someone with decent relative pitch (or perfect pitch + some minimal training) can do. But it doesn't seem right to say that recognizing intervals therefore _is_ relative/perfect pitch. And mutatis mutandis for the rest. I was also a little unclear on what you meant by a remembered reference tone. Do you mean, e.g., after hearing where A 440 is in the morning's first rehearsal, then retaining for the rest of the day (I used to be able to do that, when I was playing a lot more--though I can't anymore); I'd call that relative pitch. Do you mean knowing where A 440 is all the time (still a reference tone, just one that doesn't need to be refreshed). That sounds like perfect pitch to me."

Levitin work in this field but I still struggle. I think if we get clarity on these descriptors then we can move towards definitions.\n\nI've not been terribly helpful I know, so here is my go at a definition.\n\nRelative pitch is the musical ability to recognise a pitch or tone as belonging to a tonality and to understand and reproduce the distance between intervallic and harmonic steps without necessarily identifying the exact frequency and its associated note name.  For example, the musician with relative pitch can produce a major second interval without knowing what the first or second note is in reference to a particular key area of tonality. \n\n\n\n\n\n"

When our aural skills professor played something in one key but told us it was in another key, I had to mentally transpose to get the right notes.\n\nBut in the late 1980s and early 1990s I participated in two studies at the University of Illinois on absolute pitch, and I was told by both researchers that, because I was unable to identify tones produced as sine waves, I had only very good relative pitch. Without the upper partials I couldn't do it. I am now in my 60s, and I have more trouble identifying exact pitches than I used to: often I am a half-step off, and sometimes (especially with wind music) I have no clue. I suspect this is due to high-frequency hearing loss.\n\nI know the ability to produce tones without a reference pitch exists, because a member of a choir I directed could do it, but I never could.

288,rep_list_intend_response,I'm pretty happy with our repertoire selections at the moment.
291,rep_list_intend_response,more popular music
319,rep_list_intend_response,"I'd be really curious to see what happened if you made teaching maqamat the main focus. Of course, most of our students would scream. But I bet this would be really great ear training--perhaps they'd then be able to get their microtones right?"
32,rep_list_intend_response,"I would want to highlight works by underrepresented composers that have the same pedagogical effect as a Bach chorale or Schubert melody, but are less popular and introduce students to a wider variety of repertoire"
313,rep_list_intend_response,Iranian and other Middle Eastern music. This is not a musical tradition I use a lot (microtones and alternative tuning systems make it harder to use in a Western classical school/curriculum. Gamelan poses a similar challenge.
366,rep_list_intend_response,"More indigenous repertoire, especially in non 12-TET systems"
360,rep_list_intend_response,"Jazz, gospel, Latino music"
371,rep_list_intend_response,"more pop music, jazz\n"
386,rep_list_intend_response,None in particular.
427,rep_list_intend_response,"More Polish music, music by nineteenth-century women. "
395,rep_list_intend_response,Music the students use in life. 
44,rep_list_intend_response,"Jazz charts, non-equal—tempered music"
401,rep_list_intend_response,"I am happy with what I am teaching, although I would love to allow more opportunities for students to bring music in that we could analyze in some way together."
466,rep_list_intend_response,More popular music and jazz.
453,rep_list_intend_response,jazz
489,rep_list_intend_response,"Our aural skills instructor uses national anthems quite effectively, as they often contain triadic motives or melodies that can readily be related to a triad."
486,rep_list_intend_response,"Indonesian gamelan, maqam, mariachi, South American dance styles."
502,rep_list_intend_response,N/A
545,rep_list_intend_response,I'm given the opportunity to use any appropriate repertoire(s).
593,rep_list_intend_response,"I want to teach more Western popular music and more non-Western musics, although I believe that some styles of the latter should not be taught by instructors who do not have thorough expertise and/or personal connections with the music. I believe that much more research is necessary to support aural skills instruction in Western popular music and especially non-Western musics."
598,rep_list_intend_response,"I would probably use Motown, because the melodic content is quite varied and sophisticated and rhythmically interesting"
556,rep_list_intend_response,I have complete freedom over what rep I use -- so this question does not apply to me.
617,rep_list_intend_response,"Video game music, punk rock"
621,rep_list_intend_response,n/a
670,rep_list_intend_response,I would like to include more non-Western repertoire.

887,rep_list_intend_response,I am given the opportunity!  Rather luckily I am the module leader.
830,rep_list_intend_response,Anything--have not been teaching for years...
900,rep_list_intend_response,20th century music
896,rep_list_intend_response,"Most of what I use is fairly generic or stylistically non-descript. I am using more pop and jazz influenced style in harmonic work, and some in melody."
974,rep_list_intend_response,I'm trying to diversity the repertoire beyond the Western classical repertoire.
989,rep_list_intend_response,"I am continually looking for more sources, although I try to use mostly melodies that support the theory curriculum. We have put in a lot of work to align theory, sight singing, and keyboard curricula. The theory core is western classical, with an option to continue with jazz theory afterwards."
954,rep_list_intend_response,Singing and dictating motives and themes from standard repertoire.  Popular tunes with various 7th chords.\n
922,rep_list_intend_response,The same rep I am currently teaching. I don't have an issue with what I'm doing.
