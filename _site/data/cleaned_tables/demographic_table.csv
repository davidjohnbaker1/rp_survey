I learned Kodaly handsigns and La-based Minor in boychoir from the ages of 9-14. I learned scale degrees without inflections in undergrad. I learned Do-based minor and inflected scale degrees in grad school.  All three instances were in the United States, the first two in Wisconsin, the third in New York.\n\nThe study does not ask about how much of my aural skills courses is focused on pitch perception versus other the perception of other musical attributes, that could affect how much time is spent overall on given activities.

598,feedback,"I found the opening several sections a little bit confusing at times, but I suspect these questions were randomized and perhaps that's why. \n\nI'm also very curious to learn more about the survey takers' opinions on absolute pitch. I've had absolute pitch, very well developed, for as long as I can remember, and just about everything I've read about it has concluded that it cannot be taught, especially to music students of university age. So much so that I thought this was the general consensus, so it was somewhat surprising to see how open this survey was about it. "

815,feedback,It would be nice to learn what YOU learn from this!
695,feedback,"It would be helpful for you to provide your definition of relative pitch and absolute pitch, so that respondents know how to gauge answers to some of the questions. I don't believe these labels have shared meaning between cultures/individuals."

841,feedback,Some of the questions are excessively focused on tonal music. Post-tonal music has aural skills even conservatories too!
887,feedback,Some really deep questions here and I think I have answered all within the confines of understanding in the general.  I'd love to know how this progresses so please keep me in the loop paul.fleet@ncl.ac.uk and also let me know if I would be a useful person beyond this questionnaire.

989,feedback,"As I mentioned earlier, we do not work on developing absolute pitch with our students at all - everything is geared towards relative pitch. I also align written and aural theory with the class piano curriculum, where we drill chords, analyze everything, harmonize melodies using the same conventions as theory class, and sing on moveable-do solfege. For students with perfect pitch, I tell them to write dictations in a different key, or to not write anything while they're listening - work on the ability to memorize the melody and then write it down. This is not something I ever practiced (I have decent absolute pitch - can usually tell pitches when played on a piano, which means ear training was very easy for me) and I wish someone had told me to practice this way. Also...as a 47-year-old...my absolute pitch is slipping somewhat, which is apparently common, so practicing relative pitch exercises will help students later on in their careers."
954,feedback,"I'm interested in AP and RP.  I was trained with fixed do system from age 3 in Japan, I couldn't hear function of pitch/chords until I came to USA.   It was rough transition to RP when I was offered TA position at grad school.  I had to hear with fixed do first, then translate to movable do.  But I believe RP works best for students I teach (who do not have strong aural skills background).  As a pianist, I memorized all my music with fixed do system , and I still use it when I memorize piano works.  I need to stay in one lane (if I am teaching with RP, I need to shut off AP). "
922,feedback,the slider didn't work on mobile well.
