When our aural skills professor played something in one key but told us it was in another key, I had to mentally transpose to get the right notes.\n\nBut in the late 1980s and early 1990s I participated in two studies at the University of Illinois on absolute pitch, and I was told by both researchers that, because I was unable to identify tones produced as sine waves, I had only very good relative pitch. Without the upper partials I couldn't do it. I am now in my 60s, and I have more trouble identifying exact pitches than I used to: often I am a half-step off, and sometimes (especially with wind music) I have no clue. I suspect this is due to high-frequency hearing loss.\n\nI know the ability to produce tones without a reference pitch exists, because a member of a choir I directed could do it, but I never could. I think we need more words to describe the various stages of absolute pitch: (1) being able to produce a tone on command; (2) identifying a sine tone on command; (3) identifying tones from instruments with familiar timbres; etc.""}","""","""","""","2021-11-29 20:16:11","Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:94.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/94.0","","Firefox","94.0","Windows","10.0","447d70a80c75dce987d9c5508038710f",""

"4415","not currently teaching\"" without any area to comment on the exact situation. In my case"," I retired this past spring after teaching for 27 years at my most recent institution"," and I'm actually going to return to the faculty in the spring as an adjunct applied instructor. Technically"," I'm not currently teaching"," but some of the questions I answered as though I were"," because I believe my experience as an aural skills instructor allows me to offer useful responses. Others who are \""not currently teaching\"" may have a much more tangential relationship with aural skills instruction"," and as such would not be able to provide responses that are as useful.\n\nFinally"," I don't know if it's already your intention to do so"," but I hope that you will correlate the responses to the questions to both the training the respondents have received as well as the nature of the institution where they are either currently employed or where they've previously taught. For instance"," my last 27 years were spent teaching at a community college in a relatively rural area of a state that is usually very far down the list in terms of the quality of its education and its high-school completion rates. What I could reasonably expect from my students was far less than what I might have asked for had I been teaching in a school with selective admissions and high academic standards. That didn't stop me from trying to get the very best from my students; it's just that most of them had inferior musical experiences prior to coming to college"," and a fair number were also non-traditional students who"," in some cases"," were not only carrying a full-time course load"," these students wouldn't have made it through my classes"," and therefore they wouldn't get to realize their usually relatively modest dreams of opening a local music studio or perhaps completing a Bachelor's in Music Education and teaching in a nearby rural"," often one-school"," district. Yes"," some of my former students barely squeaked by in my relatively easy aural skills classes"," but they've turned out to be wonderful music educators nevertheless. So again"," the particular environment that each respondent teaches or has taught in needs to be taken into account when analyzing the data generated by this survey.""""}""",""

The problem often lies in a disconnect between the sound heard and the sound recognized when the task is undertaken without recourse to an instrument. During the eleventh century, Guido d’Arezzo used the joints on the hand (phalanges) to help music students recognize and sing intervals from hexachords. This article considers rethinking this tool with regard to recent investigations into corporeal intentionality. The approach is developed across three short incremental exercises that are designed for the twenty-first century musician. It begins by connecting the familiar singing of a major scale whilst pointing to the phalanges of the hand, moving towards inflecting the scale by singing and pointing to non-sequential intervals.’\n\n \nGILES First Exercise: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Xyq6sLkj10 \n\nGILES Second Exercise: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77VBWP9zWKk \n\nGILES Third Exercise: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMIOO5bE7Cw ""}","""","""","""","2021-12-01 14:42:38","Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/96.0.4664.55 Safari/537.36","Macintosh","Chrome","96.0.4664.55","OS X","10_15_7","447d70a80c75dce987d9c5508038710f",""

I also align written and aural theory with the class piano curriculum, where we drill chords, analyze everything, harmonize melodies using the same conventions as theory class, and sing on moveable-do solfege. For students with perfect pitch, I tell them to write dictations in a different key, or to not write anything while they're listening - work on the ability to memorize the melody and then write it down. This is not something I ever practiced (I have decent absolute pitch - can usually tell pitches when played on a piano, which means ear training was very easy for me) and I wish someone had told me to practice this way. Also...as a 47-year-old...my absolute pitch is slipping somewhat, which is apparently common, so practicing relative pitch exercises will help students later on in their careers.""}","""","""","""","2021-12-01 21:44:25","Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/96.0.4664.55 Safari/537.36","Macintosh","Chrome","96.0.4664.55","OS X","10_15_7","447d70a80c75dce987d9c5508038710f",""
