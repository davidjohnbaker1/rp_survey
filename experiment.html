Participants must be 18 years or older and have experience teaching music. The survey is designed to help our research team learn more about how music instructors view relative pitch and absolute pitch, including how they define these concepts and foster them in teaching. Your participation is entirely voluntary and there is no compensation.</p><p>Before continuing, please read the information below. It contains details to help you decide whether to participate. If you have questions about why the research is being done, what you will be asked to do, the possible risks and benefits, your rights as a volunteer, and anything else about the research that is not clear, you may write to any of the researchers listed above. When all your questions have been answered, you can decide if you want to be in this study. By clicking “Next” at the bottom of the screen and continuing with the survey, you agree to participate in this study.</p><p><strong>Number of People Taking the Survey</strong></p><p>We anticipate that 80-100 volunteers will take the survey.</p><p><strong>Procedure for the Suvey</strong></p><p>This survey will include both multiple-choice and free-response questions. We anticipate that it will take between 20–30 minutes to complete, depending on how much information you choose to write in the free-response questions.</p><p><strong>Risks</strong></p><p>There is a possible risk of privacy. All survey data will be collected anonymously, and we will not collect any personal information except what is useful to help us understand the results (e.g., types of classes you teach, general location [country, province/state]). However, it is possible that your responses may provide clues about your identity. Also, if you choose to comment, like, or follow this recruitment message on social media, you will be publicly identified with the study. A breach of confidentiality is also a possible risk. Breach of confidentiality means that it is possible that individuals not associated with this research may accidentally gain access to information that personally identifies participants. Appropriate safeguards are set in place to minimize a breach of confidentiality (e.g., data will be encrypted), but no researcher can ever guarantee that this sort of breach will not occur.</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><p>There is no direct benefit to taking part in this study. However, you may enjoy reflecting on relative pitch and absolute pitch in relation to your teaching activities. The results of the study may also help improve aural skills instruction.</p><p><strong>Confidentiality</strong></p>The survey is anonymous, and your name will not be associated with your responses. Only Drs. Baker, Brown, Marvin, and Tan will have access to your anonymous responses. Any study records that potentially identify you will be kept confidential to the extent possible by law, though we cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality. When study results are presented at professional conferences or published in professional journals, your name will not be used, and only averaged data will be reported.</p><p><strong>Voluntary Participation & Withdrawal</strong></p>Your decision to participate in this study is voluntary. You may choose to stop taking the survey at any time. Your responses to the questions in the study are completely anonymous and participation cannot be withdrawn after responses have been collected, as we will be unable to determine whose data is whose.</p><p>If you have questions about the research study itself, please contact the principal investigators listed above. if you have questions about your rights as a research participant or to discuss problems or concerns about a research study, or to obtain information or offer input, contact the Office of Research Ethics at ethics.review@utoronto.ca or 416-946-3273.</p><p>By clicking “Next” and continuing with the survey, you agree to participate in this study.</p>',
		'<p>Thank you for agreeing to participate in this survey. As noted before, the survey will take about 30 minutes of your time.</p><p>We have a wide range of questions in this survey that include both questions about your beliefs about absolute and relative pitch as well as your educational and teaching background.</p><p>Throughout the course of the survey, you will complete <strong>THREE</strong> sections. Please note that the way the survey is designed, you will not be able to go back and change your answers and closing the browser will delete your data.</p><p><ol><li>The <strong>first section</strong> will ask you to indicate the degree to which you agree with several assertions about both relative and absolute pitch.</li><li>The <strong>second section</strong> will ask you to describe activities that you use in your own teaching regarding relative and absolute pitch.</li><li>The <strong>third section</strong> will ask you questions about your background so we can better contextualize your answers.</li></ol></p><p>We welcome all opinions and experiences on the topic; we ask that you do not consult outside sources while completing the survey. We want you to respond based on your own experiences and the beliefs you hold now (rather than looking up a definition).</p><p>A progress bar will be displayed at the top of the page so you have an idea of how far you are into the survey. Please note that although we have divided the survey into three sections, they are not all of equal length. The first section is the longest.</p><p>If you are ready to begin, please press Next.</p>','<p>Please note that you will <strong>not be able to go backwards once you have progressed through a section</strong>.</p>'],
